      <p class="bodytext"> I really am flattered anyone would take the time to read anything I've written. The writing I've done is a way of concretizing my thoughts about a subject in that moment. If anything feels to you to be myopic, ignorant, or naïve, I ask that you forgive me. And please reach out to me. I am always learning. </p>
