    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="about">
      <p class="bodytext"> Hi! I'm Adi, an amateur furniture maker currently located in Houston, TX. I spent the majority of my childhood in Sarasota, FL and attended college at Brown University. There, I studied Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I started woodworking my sophomore year and have made a handful of pieces since. </p>
      <p class="bodytext"> I love making functional pieces of art and losing time working for hours in the shop. Woodworking has taught me many lessons but above all, it has taught me how to hold a vision in my mind and work gradually and consistently materialize it. </p>
